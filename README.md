# Pixels of Doom
A C# (.Net/Mono) command line tool to turn PNG images to Doom maps.

Includes [Bsp](http://games.moria.org.uk/doom/bsp/) for node generation on Windows.
On macOS/Linux you'll have to build nodes manually using a third-party node builder before you can play the map(s).

**Early build: no doors or things generation yet.**
